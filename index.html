                        Avalanche rescue dogs are asked to do things that would scare 
                        most dogs: fly in helicopters, ride on snowmobiles, walk through 
                        mountain snow at night with the sun's reflection off the moon as 
                        the main source of light, and get on their handler's shoulders so 
                        they can be skied down the mountain.

                        Classic movies in live action comedies would often display small 
                        barrels of brandy around their necks. Avalanche victims supposedly 
                        drank the brandy to stay warm while awaiting rescue, although this 
                        is medically unsound, but who cares? It's badass.
